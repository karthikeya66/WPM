# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides Microsoft Dev Tunnels integration for local web applications, enabling developers to expose their local development servers to the internet through secure HTTPS tunnels. The system will automatically detect running servers, create public tunnels, and provide easy management commands for starting and stopping tunnel services.

## Glossary

- **Dev Tunnels CLI**: Microsoft's command-line tool for creating secure tunnels to local development servers
- **Tunnel Service**: The background process that maintains the connection between the local server and the public endpoint
- **Local Server**: The web application running on the developer's machine (e.g., on ports 3000, 5000, 8000)
- **Public Endpoint**: The HTTPS URL provided by Microsoft Dev Tunnels that routes traffic to the local server
- **Tunnel Manager**: The system component responsible for creating, monitoring, and managing tunnel connections
- **Helper Commands**: Custom CLI commands (kiro tunnel start/stop) for easy tunnel management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically install and configure the Dev Tunnels CLI, so that I can use tunneling without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL detect if Dev Tunnels CLI is already installed on the system
2. IF Dev Tunnels CLI is not installed, THEN THE Tunnel Manager SHALL automatically download and install the CLI tool
3. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL verify the installation was successful before proceeding
4. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL configure the CLI with appropriate default settings
5. IF installation fails, THEN THE Tunnel Manager SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with my Microsoft account for Dev Tunnels, so that I can create and manage tunnels under my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL prompt the user for Microsoft account authentication when not already authenticated
2. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL use the Dev Tunnels CLI authentication flow to obtain valid credentials
3. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL store authentication tokens securely for future use
4. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL verify authentication status before creating tunnels
5. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Tunnel Manager SHALL provide clear instructions for manual authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect my local web server port, so that tunnels are created for the correct service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL scan common development ports (3000, 5000, 8000, 4000, 8080) for active HTTP services
2. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL verify that detected ports are serving HTTP/HTTPS content
3. IF multiple ports are detected, THEN THE Tunnel Manager SHALL prompt the user to select the target port
4. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL allow manual port specification as an override option
5. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL validate that the specified port is accessible before creating tunnels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create public Dev Tunnels for my local server, so that I can share my application with others or access it remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL create a new public Dev Tunnel for the detected or specified port
2. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL generate a unique, secure HTTPS URL for the tunnel
3. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL configure the tunnel with appropriate security settings
4. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL start the tunnel service in the background
5. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL display the public HTTPS URL prominently upon successful creation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tunnel to remain active while my local server is running, so that the public URL stays accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE the local server is running, THE Tunnel Service SHALL maintain an active connection to the public endpoint
2. THE Tunnel Service SHALL monitor the local server status continuously
3. IF the local server stops responding, THEN THE Tunnel Service SHALL pause the tunnel gracefully
4. WHEN the local server becomes available again, THE Tunnel Service SHALL resume the tunnel automatically
5. THE Tunnel Service SHALL log connection status changes for debugging purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic reconnection when the tunnel drops, so that my public URL remains reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tunnel Service SHALL detect when the tunnel connection is lost
2. WHEN a connection drop is detected, THE Tunnel Service SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
3. THE Tunnel Service SHALL implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
4. THE Tunnel Service SHALL retry reconnection up to 5 times before requiring manual intervention
5. THE Tunnel Service SHALL notify the user of reconnection attempts and their outcomes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want helper commands to easily manage tunnels, so that I can start and stop tunneling without complex CLI operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL provide a "kiro tunnel start" command that initiates tunnel creation and hosting
2. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL provide a "kiro tunnel stop" command that gracefully terminates active tunnels
3. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL provide a "kiro tunnel status" command that displays current tunnel information
4. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL validate command parameters and provide helpful error messages
5. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL store tunnel configuration for easy restart operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear success messages and status updates, so that I know when my application is successfully accessible online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tunnel is successfully created, THE Tunnel Manager SHALL display "âœ… Your app is live at [public URL]"
2. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL show the complete HTTPS URL in a easily copyable format
3. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL display tunnel status information including port, URL, and connection state
4. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL provide real-time updates when tunnel status changes
5. THE Tunnel Manager SHALL log all tunnel operations with timestamps for troubleshooting
